**Bluetooth Controlled Rubber Ducky based on 16u2**

## Project Overview

Blu3duck is a project that turns an Arduino into a Bluetooth-controlled Universal Keyboard/Mouse emulator with customizable VID/PID.

The project utilizes [HoodLoader2](https://github.com/NicoHood/HoodLoader2) to enable the 16u2 chip to perform these functions.
